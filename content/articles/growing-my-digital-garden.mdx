## Introduction

I remember the first time I stumbled upon a digital garden—it was on <a href='https://maggieappleton.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Maggie Appleton’s website</a> while searching for design inspiration. I read their essay titled, “A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden.” And I was hooked...

In the vast landscape of the internet, there's a growing movement and need towards more personal, authentic spaces for sharing and learning. A digital garden represents one such space—a living, breathing collection of thoughts, ideas, and knowledge that grows alongside its curator. As someone who has always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and personal growth, the concept of digital gardening immediately resonated with me.

## What is a Digital Garden?

The term "Digital Garden" emerged from the tech-savvy web logging (a.k.a. blogging) community and early internet culture. Unlike traditional blogs with their chronological posts and polished presentations, a digital garden is more organic—a space where ideas can grow, evolve, and interconnect naturally.

A digital garden is fundamentally a personal website that embodies an ideology shaped by individual experiences and creativity. It's a space where one can plant seeds—be it articles, projects, or thoughts—and tend to them over time, allowing them to grow and evolve naturally.

## My Journey to Digital Gardening

### Early Experiences with the Internet

My relationship with the digital world began in earnest in 2013 when I started managing and building WordPress websites. Growing up alongside the internet, I learned to navigate its vast information landscape, eventually finding myself managing web content for a magazine company. These experiences deepened my fascination with content management systems (CMS) and the ways we organize and share information online.

### Struggles with Perfectionism and Imposter Syndrome

Throughout my life journey, I've grappled with the struggle of perfectionism and imposter syndrome. The pressure to create flawless, complete projects often left me feeling overwhelmed. With life's many demands, the thought of releasing a "finished" side project seemed insurmountable. However, discovering the digital garden concept helped me realize that it's okay—even beneficial—to share work in progress and grow alongside my content. This realization opened the door to a new way of thinking about my creative process, leading me to embrace the concept of a digital garden.

## The Appeal of the Digital Garden

### Nurturing Ideas and Interests

The prospect of planting and nurturing ideas in my digital garden fills me with excitement. For instance, I’ve been eager to explore the idea of building my own DIY degree, as it allows me to tailor my learning to my passions and interests. I have countless interests and concepts I want to explore, and the digital garden provides the perfect framework for executing these ideas. It's not just about creating content; it's about cultivating a space where thoughts can grow and evolve organically.

### The Importance of Personal Organization

As someone with a strong Input Theme talent from CliftonStrengths, I've always found joy in collecting and organizing information. Lists, resources, and curated content are my digital tools, and the garden format allows me to maintain and share these collections in a meaningful way. My agricultural background and love for nature make the garden metaphor particularly resonant—there's beauty in tending to both physical and digital spaces.

## My Why

### Creating a Safe Space for Creativity

I need a space to build out my thoughts, ideas, projects, skills, goals, and purpose—a digital home that I truly own and control. With the skills and knowledge to create this space, I'm empowered to showcase my abilities while maintaining authenticity. This garden isn't about impressing others; it's about creating a platform for genuine expression and growth.

### Empowerment Through Digital Gardening

Building this digital garden is about more than personal development; it's about contributing to a larger community. By sharing my journey and knowledge, I hope to inspire others to create their own spaces and join in the cultivation of a more human-centered internet.

## My Goals

### Becoming My Best Self

My quest through this digital garden is to navigate the challenges of traditional systems, especially as someone with neurodiversity and multiple disabilities. In a capitalistic world that often feels misaligned with my values, this space represents my path to authentic self-expression and growth. It's about creating a system that works for me while helping others find their way.

### Creating, Connecting, and Inspiring

Through technology, I aim to empower others and foster meaningful connections. My entrepreneurial experiences have taught me valuable lessons about what works—and what doesn't—in building supportive communities. This digital garden is my platform for creating positive change and inspiring others to realize their visions.

## Final Thoughts

### The Value of Digital Gardens

In an era of "Dead Internet Theory" and algorithm-driven content, digital gardens offer a refreshing return to human-centered spaces online. By taking control of our digital presence and cultivating our own spaces, we can make the internet more authentic and meaningful.

- Authenticity: Cultivate a space for genuine expression.
- Connection: Foster relationships with like-minded individuals.
- Growth: Create a platform for continuous learning and evolution.

### A Vision for Community

I dream of a thriving community of digital gardeners—diverse individuals supporting and learning from one another. In a world that can feel overwhelming, these personal spaces can become sanctuaries of creativity and connection. Technology should enhance our humanity, not diminish it, and digital gardens are a step toward realizing that vision.

Together, we can make the digital world more compassionate, more fun, and more authentically human. After all, isn't that what technology should be about?

I invite you to join me in cultivating your own digital garden. Let’s share our journeys and create a more vibrant, human-centered internet together.
