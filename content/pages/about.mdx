## About Jake:

Hello! 👋

I'm Jake, a software engineer, a former graphic designer, a former fabricator, a lifelong learner, an amateur polymath, and a passionate explorer of life's possibilities. This digital garden is my sanctuary, a place where I cultivate my creativity, share my journey, and connect with others who are seeking a more authentic and fulfilling existence.

<hr />

Like many, I've faced my share of challenges. Living with Type 1 Diabetes and Multiple Sclerosis has taught me the importance of resilience, self-care, and living each day knowing this could be my last. I've also struggled with perfectionism and imposter syndrome, the nagging voices that tell me I'm not good enough.

But I refuse to let these challenges define me. Instead, I choose to focus on my strengths: my futuristic vision, my insatiable curiosity, my ability to connect seemingly disparate ideas, and my unwavering commitment to helping others.

<hr />

This digital garden is my way of embracing my strengths, my super powers, my archetypes, and my values. It's a space where I can:

- **Learn and grow:** As a lifelong learner, I'm constantly seeking new knowledge and exploring new ideas. This garden is my way of sharing my discoveries with you.
- **Create and build:** I'm passionate about building things, both in the digital world and in the real world. This garden is a showcase for my projects and a place where I can experiment with new technologies.
- **Inspire and empower:** I believe that everyone has the potential to live a more creative, fulfilling, and meaningful life. This garden is my way of inspiring others to pursue their passions and make a positive impact on the world.
- **Live authentically:** I'm committed to living a life that is true to myself, even when it's not easy. This garden is a reflection of my values and a space where I can be vulnerable, honest, and real.

<hr />

My vision for this digital garden is simple: to create, to connect, and to inspire ideas for individuals who are passionate about learning, growing, and making a difference in the world. I want to connect with others who are seeking a more authentic and fulfilling existence, who are willing to embrace their challenges and celebrate their strengths, and who are passionate to living life and enjoying life. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Otla5157c' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>YOLO</a>.

So, come wander through my garden. Explore my thoughts, ideas, and projects. Share your own stories and insights. Let's cultivate a more vibrant, compassionate, and authentically human world together.

And who knows, maybe we'll even inspire each other to travel more, build more, and enjoy life a little bit more along the way.
