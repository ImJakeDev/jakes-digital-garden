## This is my first blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts with you.

"Hello, World!"" has been apart of my life for awhile now. The first time I ran into this phrase was when I first started programming with WordPress in the early 20-teens.

At the time I was not very familiar with what the phrase was nor what its purpose was.

It seemed like a pretty self explanatory phrase.

Like: "Yeah, hey, I made a thing do a thing on the internet. Cool."

I was also more focused on building what I needed and the phrase seemed sort of silly to me. I knew there was some sort of significance to it but I didn't know what it was, nor did I really care. I was just trying to get my website up and running. Which was hard enough! Why would I care about _some random text_ that I am going to be deleting eventually if not immediately?

But now it means so much more to me.

When I first was building things on the internet I was self taught and I was learning as I went along.

Saying, "Hello" to the "World" was not a big deal to me.

I still had a lot to learn and I was just trying to get my website up and running. Now that I have been in the industry for a few years I see the importance of it.

It is a way to say, "Hey I made a thing on the internet and I want to share it with you."

It is a way to say, "Hey I am here and I want to share my thoughts with you."

It is a way to say, "Hey I am here and I want to share my knowledge with you."

It is a way to say, "Hey I am here and I want to share my experiences with you."

It is a way to say, "Hey I am here and I want to share my passions with you."

It is a way to say, "Hey I am here and I want to share my creativity with you."

It is a way to say, "Hey I am here and I want to share with you, **World**."

It is more than a program that has an output of a string of characters.

It is the Start of something new. Something that is exciting and something that is worth sharing. It is a way to say, "**Hello, World!**"

It is also a way to test your code and make sure it is outputting what you want it to output and that its working correctly. üòú

But where is the fun philosophy in that? üòÇ

If you are not a programmer you may think it is a bit silly. I sure did when I first started programming. But it is important because it is the first step in learning something new. It is the first step in building something amazing. It is the first step in sharing something with the world. It is the first step in saying, "Hello, World!". It is still a bit silly let's be honest. But that is perfectly okay. Why can't we be silly when we are building something new? Not everything should be serious. Might just be me but I think its is good to have fun when you are working one something you passionate to build.

```tsx
welcomeMessage();
```

Hello, World! üëã

I'm Jake nice to meet you. üòÅ
